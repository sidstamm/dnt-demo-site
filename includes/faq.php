    <h4 class="expander-header">What is Do Not Track?</h4>
    <div class="expander-content">
      <p>Do Not Track is a step toward putting you in control of the way your
        information is collected and used online. Do Not Track is a feature in Firefox that
        allows you to let a website know you would like to opt-out of third-party tracking for
        purposes including behavioral advertising. It does this by transmitting a Do Not Track
        HTTP header every time your data is requested from the Web.</p>

  <div class="expander expander-odd">
    <h4 class="expander-header">Is Do Not Track available on Firefox for Android?</h4>
    <div class="expander-content">
      <p>Yes. Firefox for Android is the first mobile Web browser to offer
        the Do Not Track privacy feature, and behaves the same way it does on the
        desktop. To turn Do Not Track on in Firefox for Android, simply swipe left and
        tap on Browser Tools. From the Preferences pane, tap on the box next to &quot;Tell
        sites not to track me&quot; to turn this option on or off.  </p>

    <h4 class="expander-header">Does Do Not Track block ads?</h4>
    <div class="expander-content">
      <p>No, you will still see ads with Do Not Track enabled. However, Do Not Track
        may change the type of ads you see. For example, behavioral ads are targeted to your
        interests based on the websites you visit and the search terms you use. If you request
        that websites Do Not Track you, and the sites respect your privacy preferences, you
        will see more generic ads in place of behavioral ads.</p>

    <h4 class="expander-header">How does Do Not Track work with other privacy tools?</h4>
    <div class="expander-content">
      <p>Do Not Track is one of many privacy solutions. Do Not Track does not replace your
        anti-virus software, will not encrypt data, and is not a security mechanism. There are
        several other <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/security">privacy and
        security</a> features within Firefox.</p>

    <h4 class="expander-header">Will Do Not Track affect the rest of my Web experience?</h4>
    <div class="expander-content">
      <p>Do Not Track may interfere with some personalized services you enjoy. For example, a Do Not Track request might mean you would have to type in your zip code each time you want to view a weather report, rather than seeing the weather automatically displayed. Personalization on websites can save you time and repetitive typing, but it requires data.</p>
